Hi, Bhavya here project elements are:

1.Python 3.x\
2.Selenium\
3.Tkinter\
4.Chromedriver(according to the chrome version)\
The first page of the folder:

## CodesForBot- 
### Contains code in the .py file 
- only code is the program i made in the idle 
- directory code requires the driver to be in the directory 
- standalone code does not function from the idle but from the .exe app 
- UI code is for exe but with GUI 
- UI code raw is not for exe

## Directory/Standalone/UIAppFolder- 
### Is the first folder the project was created in 
- Dist and spec files were created by the PyInstaller library 
- Dist contains the directory for directory/standalone apps 
- Spec contains the information for the installer

## Driver- 
### Contains the chromedriver which is essential for the selenium to function 
- Driver can be found in all directories except the raw code file as the path is stated in the program files folder instead 
- Driver also has icon for UI bot

#### BYE!
